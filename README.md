One of the aspects I found most interesting during the Android Basics with Compose Codelab was the **preview** feature in Android Studio. It's incredibly convenient to visualize @Composable functions directly in the IDE without having to run the app on an emulator. This instant feedback loop not only speeds up development, but also makes it much easier to experiment with design ideas and layouts without having to fully build the app.

Another interesting aspect was how easy it is to add a visually appealing color theme using the **Material Theme Builder**. The seamless integration of Material Design principles allows for a consistent and professional look with minimal effort, and customizing the theme for colors, typography and shapes feels intuitive.

I also enjoyed learning how to apply architectural patterns, particularly the **Model-View-ViewModel** (MVVM) pattern. While splitting code into three files initially felt cumbersome for smaller projects, it became clear how this approach improves code clarity, organization, and scalability in larger applications.

Finally, **adapting screens to different sizes** and formats was an eye-opener. Previously, I hadn't considered the need to design for different devices and orientations. Even though this makes the coding and design process more complex, I now realize the importance of responsive design for a seamless user experience on all devices.
